This is my Techdegree Unit 1 Project 

The initial project was to create a project that generates a random quote and random color for that quote. The quotes were to be stored in an array within the javascript file.

I completed this project as the first of ten projects for my Team Treehouse Full Stack Tech-Degree program.

Since then I have created a MongoDBAtlas database to store the quotes in and have created a serverless function using MongoDBRealm to serve all the quotes in the qoutes table. This was a really cool addon as this will allow me to add a form to add more quotes through this page.
